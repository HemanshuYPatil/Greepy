Place bundled Whisper assets here for release builds:
- whisper-cli.exe
- whisper/ggml runtime DLLs when using dynamic builds (for example: whisper.dll, ggml.dll, ggml-base.dll, ggml-cpu.dll)

Tiny Whisper models are disabled in the app. Keep your larger model (for example: ggml-large-v3.bin) in a local path and select it in-app when prompted.
